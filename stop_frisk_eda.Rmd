## Data Cleaning

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load Dataset
sqf = read_csv("./sqf-2018.csv", na = c("(null)", "XXX","N/A")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


```

**Data Cleaning Notes**

* Variables that only have 'Y' and 'NA' as an input were eliminated.
* Our outcome variable (either arrests or frisk) are categorical outcomes. This will be a good dataset for classification.
